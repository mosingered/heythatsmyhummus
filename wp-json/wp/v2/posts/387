Twenty episodes! Where has the time gone?!?<\/p>\n<p>It was just about one year ago that Faiqa and Shiny first discussed the idea of collaborating on a project that would ultimately become <em>Hey! That&#8217;s My Hummus!<\/em>\u00a0 First we were thinking about co-authoring a blog. Then it was a book. Then a news-based television show. Then it was a wacky sitcom about two families, one Muslim and one Jewish, who share a backyard and a miniature talking horse named Vinny. And ultimately? We decided to set our aspirations higher and work together on a podcast.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a wonderful twenty podcasts. We&#8217;ve talked about a multitude of different subjects. We&#8217;ve laughed, yelled, agreed, disagreed, disagreed even more, and vehemently disagreed. And we love it. And we look forward to bringing you many more in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Since Faiqa is at <em>BlogHer &#8217;11<\/em>\u00a0this week, we&#8217;ve decided to put together a compilation of two segments from past shows: the first is the reason for the namesake of the podcast &#8212; the great hummus debate. \u00a0Our pilot episode had this topic span over two, fifteen-minute segments, but we&#8217;ve cut it down to just one. \u00a0And then we look back at our discussion about the advent of a Muslim superhero in the Batman comic book series &#8212; and the prevalence of religious diversity within the superhero world.<\/p>\n<p>And if you thought it didn&#8217;t get any better than that &#8212; <em>we have a special, surprise guest host this week! \u00a0 <\/em>Many thanks to this awesome person for helping us out.<\/p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t listened to our podcast before, this is a great one to listen to for a taste of what we&#8217;re all about. \u00a0If you have listened, please share this one amongst your friends if you think they might like it. \u00a0But listen anyway because &#8212; hey!
