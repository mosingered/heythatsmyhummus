That&#8217;s My Hummus!<\/em> you may have heard me mention a recent news story about <a title=\"CNN - Prayers Spark Scare on Airplane\" href=\"http:\/\/religion.blogs.cnn.com\/2011\/03\/14\/prayers-spark-scare-on-airplane\/\" target=\"_blank\">an Alaska Airlines flight from Mexico City to L.A. which went into panic mode<\/a>. The cause for this? \u00a0Three Jewish passengers, in mid-flight, took out and started putting on <em>tefillin,<\/em> which are ritual prayer\u00a0accoutrements.\u00a0\u00a0The flight attendants observed these passengers doing something out of the ordinary (standing up soon after takeoff) with something out of the ordinary (the aforementioned <em>tefillin<\/em>) in a language with was out of the ordinary (Hebrew with a bit of Aramaic thrown in). \u00a0The plane landed safely at LAX, greeted by US Customs, Border Patrol and FBI agents. The passengers explained themselves and were allowed to go along their merry way. Alaska Airlines has since apologized for the whole incident.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the first time that this has happened, and it certainly won&#8217;t be the last.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/tefillin_02.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-59\" title=\"tefillin_02\" src=\"http:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/tefillin_02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"226\" \/><\/a>Some people blame the airline for their ignorance of Jewish tradition. Some blame the specific passengers in question for engaging in behavior which went against the grain of what was considered normal. Some hold the heightened fear of air terror as the culprit here. Although I would agree that changes on the part of each of these three components may have prompted a very different experience which would not have ended in a security alert, I choose to point my finger at something else entirely:<\/p>\n<p><em>This would have never happened if the airlines were still serving free meals on short flights.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Think about it: our children are growing up in an environment where exposure to the term &#8220;kosher airline meal&#8221; is foreign to them. Since free meals aren&#8217;t served on most domestic flights (and since the ones they offer for a premium are not specifically kosher), we&#8217;re no longer sensitized to the differences between many of our fellow passengers. And with that, \u00a0we automatically cut off the notion that people who look, talk or act different are just like us. And we have many things in common. Such as the fact that the airline food in front of us, whether kosher or not, will probably suck.<\/p>\n<p>Okay. It&#8217;s a bit of a stretch. \u00a0But I think the environment for flying post-9\/11 has put people in a frenzy to point out anything and anyone that appears to be out of place. For some, out-of-place could be anything unexperienced, such as a Jew putting on <em>tefilin.<\/em> Or a Muslim engaged in <em>Salat (<\/em>traditional\u00a0prayer). Or two adults of the same sex holding hands as a couple. A diabetic injecting herself with insulin. A family dressed differently speaking in a foreign language. The list goes on and on. We&#8217;re asked to report anything suspicious, and we do. \u00a0But we need to distinguish between &#8220;suspicious&#8221; and &#8220;different.&#8221; I don&#8217;t have any great solutions to this &#8212; aside from learning and asking questions.<\/p>\n<p>When I fly with my wife, we have our own ritual of reciting <em>Tefilat HaDerech,<\/em> a short, Hebrew prayer which focuses on a pleasant journey free from challenges. In recent years, I&#8217;ve noticed that we&#8217;ve instinctively been less\u00a0conspicuous\u00a0about this ritual. We don&#8217;t huddle together to read the words, hunched over as if we&#8217;re planning something. We don&#8217;t say the words in Hebrew out loud lest we garner attention from that rare individual who might think the worst. \u00a0It doesn&#8217;t bother me, though, nor would the thought of me explaining myself with a smile.<\/p>\n<p>There are those in the Jewish community who have specified that if these travelers wanted to put on <em>tefilin,<\/em> they could have done so before or after the 4-hour flight rather than do so on the plane. Obviously these passengers disagreed. But I do feel that a great deal of the fears could have been calmed by a &#8220;heads up&#8221; explanation. \u00a0<em>I&#8217;m just engaging in my ritual prayer. These are just black boxes with parchment inside, and I&#8217;ll wrap them on my arm with these leather straps. I may stand up and sit down, but I&#8217;ll be as respectful as I possibly can. After I&#8217;m done, I&#8217;m happy to answer any questions while we both enjoy our delicious airline meals&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Well, I suppose I can dream about that last part, can&#8217;t I?<\/p>\n<p>To conclude, I&#8217;d like to share a video.
