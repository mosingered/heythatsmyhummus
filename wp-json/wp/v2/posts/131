it is a religion.\u00a0 And, like all religions, Islam has proven malleable and it possesses the wonderful ability to be inserted into existing traditions and practices.\u00a0 Finally, I suspect that the inability to make this distinction lies at the heart of most Islamaphobic rhetoric, therefore it&#8217;s pretty critical to make this leap in understanding.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019m curious, how much of your wedding was religious and how much of it was cultural?\u00a0 Does your faith have the same dynamic as mine or is every practice grounded in revelation?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>** Have you listened to Episode 4: Conflicted, Slaughtering and Prince William&#8217;s Wedding, yet?\u00a0 Download on iTunes or listen here ** &nbsp;
