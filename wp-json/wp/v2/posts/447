I\u2019m talking about the <em>other<\/em> ones.\u00a0 I&#8217;m talking about the ones you should get over.

That\u2019s My Hummus\u201d style to point out that most people don\u2019t take the time to ask questions about social difference, and instead opt to avoid the problem like that one ex who still lives in the same part of town as you.<\/p>\n<p>(Funny how they always get a text message right before they pass you on the street, isn\u2019t it?)<\/p>\n<p>(Anyways, this is sad. Stop it.)<\/p>\n<p>I would like to take this year\u2019s Hummus Hiatus to talk to you <del>about myself<\/del> about one of the things that people don\u2019t ever want to ask me about, that people actually <em>should<\/em> ask me about.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to answer your questions and thereby systematically eliminate any excuses that make me feel unpopular.<br \/>\n<strong>Awkward Thing About Me: <\/strong><em>\u2028I am a vegetarian.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>There.\u00a0 I said it.<\/p>\n<p>I know what you think that means.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m obviously a PETA-card-carrier, I throw paint at fur clothes, and will make you cry if you ever speak about meat around me, right?\u00a0 I would like to point out that, like the most visible of any group, these people are not representative of \u201cour kind;\u201d these are the Taliban and the Westboro Baptist Church of vegetarianism. \u00a0<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>This, of course, begs the question of what prompts people into vegetarianism if it isn\u2019t, you know, a militant love of cows.\u00a0 Animals are cute, I think we\u2019ll all give you that, but my parents keep chickens behind their house, and I shed no tears when I see a wing or breast on the grill, my friends.<\/p>\n<p>There are tons of reasons to eat a vegetarian diet.\u00a0 Since you\u2019re more likely to meet a vegetarian than <em>this<\/em> vegetarian, here are some explanations.<\/p>\n<p>Some of us were cursed with a family history of health problems that are aggravated by high-fat and \u2013cholesterol diets. ::Raises hand::<\/p>\n<p>Some of us want to lose weight (remember how I just implied that meat heavy diets are high-fat and \u2013cholesterol diets?\u00a0 Low\/no-meat diets are freakin\u2019 awesome for you.)\u00a0 Others worry about the resources that go into it.\u00a0 It takes a lot more work and money to raise a cow or pig for a few years than it does to grow a squash, just so you know.\u00a0 Good for the environment, good for you.<\/p>\n<p>Okay, back to me. (Yay!)<\/p>\n<p>Despite all of this, I am still the scourge of a dinner party.\u00a0 It\u2019s like high school gossip for me:\u00a0 I somehow cause drama that I didn\u2019t have anything to do with.\u00a0 (They\u2019re saying I did what?\u00a0 Really?\u00a0 I didn\u2019t touch the guy.)<\/p>\n<p>Examples:<br \/>\n&#8220;Can I still serve meat dishes?&#8221; asks the host.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, yes you can.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Is he judging me for eating this burger?&#8221; ask the guests.<\/p>\n<p>No, I&#8217;m judging you for smothering it in half a bottle of ketchup. Mustard goes on burgers, not ketchup.\u2026seriously.\u00a0 You had me rooting for you.\u00a0 That double cheeseburger (with bacon, if you&#8217;re not keeping kosher!) looked delicious before you drowned it in tomato-y, syrup-y nastiness.<\/p>\n<p>I believe is the philosophy of HTMH, <em>ask<\/em> <strong>questions<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Not only will you make me or your local Veg Head feel interesting and popular, but you might actually make a friend out of us.\u00a0 Make it a bonding experience.
