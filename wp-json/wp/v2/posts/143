The Torah (or &#8220;Five Books of Moses&#8221;) appear in both the Hebrew Bible (called the <em>TaNaCH<\/em> for reasons I won&#8217;t get into here) as well as the Christian one. \u00a0The verses pertaining to <em>Sotah<\/em> can be found in the Book of Numbers, Chapter 5, verses 11-31. You can read <a title=\"JPS Translation - Numbers 5\" href=\"http:\/\/mechon-mamre.org\/e\/et\/et0405.htm\" target=\"_blank\">one translation here<\/a> if you&#8217;d like.<\/p>\n<p>Let me give you a bit of a rundown, section by section:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Verses 11-14:<\/span> <em>Heard it from a friend who \/ heard it from a friend who \/ heard it from a friend you&#8217;ve been messin&#8217; around&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Verses 15-16:<\/span> If a man suspects his \u00a0[pregnant?] wife of cheating on him, he brings her to the priest and makes a sacrifice-offering towards God.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Verses 17-18:<\/span> The priest mixes together a concoction of special water and dust in an earthenware vessel. The water gets really nasty. And, apparently cursed.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Verses 19-22:<\/span> The priest tells the woman: &#8220;I want you to swear that you&#8217;ve remained faithful to your husband and are not looking for heightened drama on Maury Povich&#8217;s talk show. After that, you&#8217;ll drink this nasty concoction. If you&#8217;re telling the truth, no problem &#8212; everything will be fine. But if you&#8217;re not? Your pregnancy will end in a most horrible way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Verses 23-31:<\/span> Pretty much a repetition of exactly what the priest explained would happen. If she was unfaithful? Nastiness. Swelling in the belly. Miscarriage. Part of her thigh falls away. (Ew.) If she&#8217;s been faithful? No harm at all. \u00a0But here&#8217;s the clincher: <em>this is all to placate the jealous husband!<\/em> So he&#8217;ll know. And he&#8217;ll feel better knowing the truth. The end.<\/p>\n<p><em>How can anyone follow a religion in 2011 which encompasses savage rules like this in its Holy Scripture?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a valid question. One which I&#8217;ve wrestled with myself. And one that has made people of all religions challenge themselves to the belief systems of today as they intersect with traditions of the past. It brings up even more questions: <em>As a Jew, does this mean I need to believe in these outrageous rules? Do I need to follow all of them to the letter of the law? Can I simply ignore them as part of an antiquated system that no longer applies?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t speak for members of other religions. I can&#8217;t even speak for all Jews. I can only speak for myself &#8212; and the way I understand the rules and customs of my tradition &#8212; which allow me to intersect my so-called modern life with the traditions as outlined in the Torah. Here&#8217;s how I do so:<\/p>\n<p>I believe that\u00a0<strong>Traditional Judaism as we know it today does not adhere to the Torah in a vacuum. <\/strong> Whether one is of the belief that the Torah was handed to Moses atop Mount Sinai a la <em>The Ten Commandments <\/em>or whether it was a divinely inspired collaboration stitched together of different manuscripts centuries later, it&#8217;s still an important source. But the conversations <em>about<\/em> the Torah are just as crucial.<\/p>\n<p>Which is why you&#8217;ll find that traditional Jewish law holds the many discussions, arguments and debates about the words of the Torah in high regard. \u00a0We&#8217;re talking about arguments between scholars who are interpreting the messages of God. These are not prophets; these are people. Humans. And what they have to add to the conversation becomes part of the tradition &#8212; and has its own sense of holiness.<\/p>\n<p>Which is precisely why I&#8217;m proud of the scholars generations ago taking a look at this outrageous and barbaric set of laws concerning <em>Sotah<\/em> and trying to figure out why something so awful would appear in the Torah in the first place. What was the message? When was it really supposed to be used? What is the symbolism of the sacrifice offered by the jealous husband? \u00a0Was there really a special potion used? Or was this, in fact, a simple scare tactic used to get adulterous women to confess?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s nice to see that our generation isn&#8217;t the first to wrestle with these issues. And that, generations ago, people <em>were<\/em> thinking about the consequences. Which is why the practice of \u00a0<em>Sotah<\/em> was abolished about 2000 years ago. Yes &#8212; even though it&#8217;s mentioned right there in the Torah. Our tradition allows people to be a part of the law process.<\/p>\n<p>And frankly? That&#8217;s kind of neat. Because it allows for us to connect not with a static set of rules, but a dynamic set of traditions. It allows us to ask questions about how we can discuss modern day issues within the framework of the Torah and its commentaries. It makes my Judaism more of a living, breathing animal rather than something old and non-evolving.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sotah<\/em> has evolved out of practice. But we&#8217;ve learned from it &#8212; even if it has simply been replaced by a cheesy REO Speedwagon lyric.<\/p>\n<p>httpv:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=J010sooBvp4<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>** Have you listened to Episode 3, yet?\u00a0 Download on iTunes or listen\u00a0here ** I mentioned some troubling things about Jewish law in our last episode.\u00a0\u00a0We were talking about the Muslim legal concept of Diyyat (monetary remuneration for killing someone), and I expressed some information about Jewish law that doesn&#8217;t usually get included in one&#8217;s&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[17],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/143"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=143"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/143\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":148,"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/143\/revisions\/148"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=143"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=143"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=143"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
