It&#8217;s been a long time?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This break between shows was just a bit longer. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>You see &#8212; we recorded a show on the eve of the second presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.  Our show was our impressions of the <em>first<\/em> debate between the two. We were talking about all of the outrageous, unprecedented things that were happening during this presidential race. Things that we simply couldn&#8217;t fathom happening.<\/p>\n<p>Until the next day when something even more outrageous happened. And then the next day. And then the next. Things got busy, things got intense, and we decided that we would resume our podcast right after the presidential election and the obvious victory of Hillary Clinton, the first female president elect of the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Things turned out a bit differently.<\/p>\n<p>The election results threw us for a loop. Both Faiqa and Mike had very strong concerns (we still do!) about the direction that our country was taking and has continued to take.  What does it mean when we saw that so many people voted for a candidate who has said disparaging things about women, Muslims, immigrants and many other people? How do we process a nation which is so utterly divided and needs something or someone to bring us together? What happens when there is a void in the position to do exactly that?<\/p>\n<p>What do we do as we begin 2017 with a new administration? What are the next steps?<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what we talk about in this episode &#8212; which we recorded on Sunday, January 8, 2017 &#8212; mere hours before Faiqa&#8217;s birthday. It&#8217;s longer than usual. And emotional. It took a long while for us to be back at a point where we felt we could do this. But we&#8217;re so grateful that we <I>are<\/I> back.
