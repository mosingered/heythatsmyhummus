That\u2019s My Hummus.<\/em><\/a><\/strong><br \/>\nOk, so I\u2019m a little behind. I\u2019ll blame it on the apocalypse.<\/p>\n<p>The third segment of the podcast inspired some thoughts on pop music. Faiqa and Shiny pondered whether <a href=\"https:\/\/www.heythatsmyhummus.com\/2011\/05\/episode-8-pakistan-invisible-hillary-its-friday-we-so-excited\/\">Rebecca Black as Internet sensation was \u201cthe future of pop music.\u201d<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here are my thoughts:<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m an admitted music snob. My tastes are eclectic and run the gamut from well known acts like Dave Matthews, The Black Eyed Peas, and Allison Krauss to lesser known musicians like <a href=\" www.vinx.com\">Vinx, <\/a><a href=\"www.nickelcreek.com\">Nickel Creek<\/a>, and <a href=\"www.myspace.com\/sonosings\">Sonos.<\/a> Never heard of those last three artists? Check \u2018em out! You won\u2019t be sorry.<\/p>\n<p>Pop music is here to stay. Popular songs have been a part of the American landscape since <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stephen_Foster\">Stephen Foster raged onto the scene in the 1800s with Camptown Races, Oh! Susanna, and Swannee River<\/a>. Remember those rockin\u2019 tunes? Through the decades, popular music comes and goes. So do pop artists.<\/p>\n<p>Admittedly, the Internet has made pop stardom more accessible for the amateur musician with superstar aspirations but I think that pop stars can be classified into one of four categories:<strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Exhibit A:<em> The Average Joe\/Jane One-Hit Wonder<\/em><\/strong>: These are the musicians who catch their big break thanks to the viral video or an opportunity to appear on a reality show. They hit the airwaves and catch their 15 minutes of fame but 6 months..2 years\u20265 years from now, we\u2019ll see them on Where Are They Now?\u00a0 Examples: Rebecca Black, Susan Boyle, Taylor Hicks<strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Exhibit B: <em>The Average Joe\/Jane With Staying Power<\/em><\/strong>: Like the previous example, these musicians find success with a lucky break but thanks to a convergence of just the right elements: good connections, a marketing plan, and (oh yeah) talent, they\u2019re not only getting top 10 hits but winning awards, expanding their career, and making a living as a musician. Kudos! Examples: Jennifer Hudson, LeAnn Rimes, Carrie Underwood<br \/>\n<strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Exhibit C: <em>The Traditional Pop Star Trajectory<\/em><\/strong>: Then there are the \u201csigned\u201d artists. These are the musicians who are discovered and contracted by the increasingly irrelevant music labels (more on that in a minute).\u00a0 Supposedly, these folks are vetted by the record execs for talent, poise, and star power.\u00a0 They rise to the scene with varying degrees of success and their staying power is just as volatile. You\u2019d think their chances of success (monetary and otherwise) would be a sure thing but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. A few who stand the test of time: Justin Timberlake, Beyonce, and Queen Latifah.<br \/>\n<strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Exhibit D: <em>The Grassroots Internet Sensation<\/em><\/strong>: Finally, there are musicians who find success and rise out of their relative obscurity thanks, in large part, to the world-wide-web.\u00a0 These days, technology allows any schlub with a video camera and some recording equipment the opportunity to market and sell their music on the Internet (either through iTunes or their own websites).\u00a0 Unsigned artists finally have a way to rise from the status of Wedding Singer to Rock Star with just a few clicks. My favorite example of this is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/blogs\/money\/2011\/05\/14\/136279162\/an-internet-rock-star-te lls-all\">Jonathan Coulton who left his job as an IT professional to make it as a musician<\/a>. He\u2019s sold and marketed his music through his website and social media word-of-mouth.\u00a0 His take-home pay last year? Almost $500,000! Other examples include<a href=\"ww.righteousbabe.com\/ani\"> Ani DiFranco<\/a> and <a href=\" www.pomplamoose.com\">Pomplamoose<\/a> (now finding success with Hyundai Commericals).<\/p>\n<p>Pop Stars: One Hit Wonders, Viral Video Flameouts, Reality Stars, and Bonafide Overnight Success Stories.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s room for everyone thanks to the World-Wide-Web. If you\u2019re lucky enough, you might be next!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Do you have an idea for a guest post based on any of our episodes?
