I think you&#8217;ll find it funny &#8212; even if you&#8217;re not Jewish.<\/p>\n<p>The thing is?<em> The story is pretty spot on. <\/em>The concept of an <em>eruv<\/em> (a &#8220;fence&#8221; around an area to enclose it as its own domain) has a long, rich history in traditional Judaism. There are many rules and laws that have been passed down in Judaism and have been studied, interpreted and argued by scholars through many generations as they attempted to wrestle with conserving the traditions with applying those to practical, modern-day use.<\/p>\n<p>Take, for instance, the rules of observing the Sabbath. Deriving from the Fourth Commandment (of that epic film <em>The Ten Commandments)<\/em>, it is commanded that one should &#8220;remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.&#8221; (<a title=\"Exodus 20:7\" href=\"http:\/\/mechon-mamre.org\/p\/pt\/pt0220.htm\" target=\"_blank\">JPS translation, Exodus 20:7<\/a>). The passage goes on to explain that &#8220;work&#8221; should not be done during the Sabbath. Simple enough, right?<\/p>\n<p>But wait &#8212; what specifically is &#8220;work?&#8221; Scholars of Hebrew Scripture tasked themselves to figure out what this would mean in a practical application. And they found that, later on in the Book of Exodus, there were 39 categories of activities when building the Tabernacle (think <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark<\/em>)\u00a0 which were, in a roundabout way, prohibited on the Sabbath. From this they inferred that these 39 activities were meant as the prohibited &#8220;work.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One of those 39 activities is &#8220;carrying.&#8221; Which means that, according to many traditional Jews, even carrying one&#8217;s keys from place to place on the Sabbath is prohibited. Same goes with carrying your 18 month old to synagogue. Or pushing her in a stroller. End of discussion, right?<\/p>\n<p>But wait &#8212; do we really want the Sabbath to be about sequestering people in their homes (within one&#8217;s home you can carry things; the prohibition is seen as going <em>between<\/em> locales on the outside)? Do we want people to be able to lock their doors as they take a nice, Saturday morning stroll? How does Judaism apply these laws towards practical, real-life issues?<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where the <em>eruv<\/em> comes in: those who hold by the custom will allow the <em>eruv<\/em> to <em>enclose<\/em> a larger area <em>and treat it as one locale.<\/em> So it&#8217;s as if you&#8217;re really carrying your keys (or your kid) <em>within<\/em> one place if you&#8217;re within the confines of an <em>eruv.<\/em> Is it cheating? I don&#8217;t think so. Is it a loophole? Arguably &#8212; yes.<\/p>\n<p>Is it a hindrance to those who don&#8217;t even know (or care) that it&#8217;s there? No. As it&#8217;s mentioned in the clip above, it&#8217;s practically invisible. If you&#8217;re not looking for it, you likely wouldn&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s there.<\/p>\n<p>But the implications of an <em>eruv,<\/em> as mentioned comically in the Daily Show piece, extend beyond a simple piece of string around the town. If there&#8217;s a large enough Jewish community wanting an <em>eruv,<\/em> it&#8217;ll likely push for an <em>eruv.<\/em> Which will likely ensure that an <em>eruv<\/em> is put up. Which will attract other traditional Jews who are looking for a place to live which has an <em>eruv.<\/em> Hence &#8212; a larger concentration of (mostly Orthodox) Jews looking for an <em>eruv.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I think we see this in many different communities already. If there&#8217;s a large Spanish-speaking population in a certain part of town (in the USA), it&#8217;s likely that some businesses will cater to this population with bilingual signage. Which may attract other Spanish speakers to that part of town.\u00a0 Same goes for other pockets of homogeneous people. Which is why you might find Arab neighborhoods. Gay neighborhoods. Neighborhoods rich with Kansas City Royals fans. Places where people feel comfortable with the familiarity of their communities.<\/p>\n<p>Is this a good thing? Is this self-segregation harmful to the way we interact with out neighbors? Or is it an inevitable feature of what happens when people try to feel comfortable with their own identities? Although I quite enjoy living in a diverse neighborhood, I certainly have enjoyed the benefits of living in areas where my community was surrounding me a bit closer.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps there&#8217;s an <em>eruv<\/em> around communities &#8212; not necessarily Jewish ones &#8212; which unify them as one unit, too.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8230; and if you ask nicely, I&#8217;ll delve into the type of eruv that allows you to lump Thursday and Friday together with Wednesday for culinary purposes.
