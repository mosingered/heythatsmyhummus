That&#8217;s My Hummus!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This one was a bit different than most: \u00a0we didn&#8217;t talk about current events, holidays, cultural traditions or Justin Bieber. \u00a0 Instead, we talked about assumptions people make about us based on our multi-faceted identities. \u00a0We&#8217;re not just the Jew and the Muslim who jointly host a podcast together; we&#8217;re identified by our genders, our occupations, our ethnicities, our political stances and more. So we both took five assumptions people make about each of us and talked to each other about them.<\/p>\n<p>And it was truly eye-opening.<\/p>\n<p>But you&#8217;ll have to take our word for it because we&#8217;ve listened to it live and you haven&#8217;t yet. \u00a0I&#8217;m doing the post-processing and (hopefully) will have this ready for you by the end of the weekend.
