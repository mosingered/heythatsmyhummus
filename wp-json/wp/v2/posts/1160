This podcast was recorded on February 15 &#8212; the day after Valentine&#8217;s Day!  The day after the day celebrating love (which technically is also a day to celebrate love. Like the other 363 days of the year. But anyway&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>So: We finally get around to talking about interfaith relationships and what our respective communities think about them. And why. Are attitudes changing? Are there certain challenges when a relationship or marriage crosses cultural or religious boundaries? We take a look at some of the relationships of those close to us and discuss.<\/p>\n<p>We want you to support us in so many ways:  of course there&#8217;s the Amazon Banner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.heythatsmyhummus.com\/amazon\">https:\/\/www.heythatsmyhummus.com\/amazon<\/a>. Click on it and shop like you normally would on Amazon.com. We just get a little help. Also? Warby Parker&#8217;s great deal is still on! You can click here for further info: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.warbyparkertrial.com\/hummus\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.warbyparkertrial.com\/hummus<\/a> .<\/p>\n<p>But enough about helping us: I mentioned a company which I decided to plug because they&#8217;re awesome and they&#8217;re going through a rough time: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bluprintchocolatiers.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bl\u00fcprint Chocolatiers<\/a> is a local business in Alexandria, VA which has absolutely delicious treats. They happen to, by no fault of their own, be in the spotlight as they now share a building with professional hater Rich@rd Spencer. And some people have gathered that there is a connection between the chocolate shop and the racist tenant (which there is not). So &#8212; they deserve a lot of love. (And they&#8217;re working on an efficient means for delivery!) Check them out&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>And, naturally, you can reach us at the usual places: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/HeyThatsMyHummus\/\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/HeyThatsMyHummus\/<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ThatsMyHummus\" target=\"_blank\">@ThatsMyHummus<\/a> on Twitter.
