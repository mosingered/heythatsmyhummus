Maybe.)<\/p>\n<p>We took a pretty long hiatus after recording a good 74 episodes or so from 2011 through 2013.  And some of these older episodes discuss some fascinating subjects which relate to what&#8217;s going on nowadays.  For instance &#8212; we discussed the riots in Great Britain following the police shooting of a Black man which outraged a nation in our episode #22 recorded in August 2011.  This was before the world had heard of Michael Brown, Eric Gardner or Tamir Rice.  And with the latest episodes of African-American men being shot and killed by police officers as well as the tragic assassination of police officers in Dallas following a Black Lives Matter march, listening to what we discussed back then was rather interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Hillary Clinton&#8217;s email investigation remains a hot topic in 2016. It stemmed from emails subpoenaed regarding the Benghazi attacks on the American Embassy to Libya in September of 2012 in which four Americans were killed &#8212; and where there was some initial confusion as to the nature of the events leading up to the attack. A parallel protest was occurring at the American Embassy in Cairo and it was thought that something similar was happening in Benghazi when initial assessments were made.  In episode #58 we talk about &#8220;The Innocence of Muslims,&#8221; the inflammatory film which outraged Muslims in the Middle East and worldwide.  You can listen to our analysis before we knew that this would become a talking point against Secretary Clinton for the next several years.<\/p>\n<p>As always, please tell us what you think on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/HeyThatsMyHummus\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/ThatsMyHummus\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter<\/a>.
