coming from a brown woman\u2019s purse in the middle of the mall.<\/p>\n<p>While it may seem like the concept of modernity plays into my choice to use a smartphone app, that\u2019s not really where I was going with that.<\/p>\n<p>Modernity and my faith are being negotiated in this instance in a far more granular way.<\/p>\n<p>My app has a setting that allows the prayer notification to be set to a \u201cbeep.\u201d\u00a0 Specifically, three beeps.<\/p>\n<p>I have conscientiously chosen to disable the beeps at the prayer times that I am most likely to skip.\u00a0 For me, that\u2019s Zuhr and Asr, the ones that come right in the middle of the day.\u00a0 That\u2019s when I get busy, go grocery shopping or to the park, get tired, or am just not feeling up to all that bowing and kneeling.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s when I need to hear someone remind me that it\u2019s time to step away from life and remember God the most.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Every day somewhere around 1:30 and 5:00, I need to hear someone sing to  me that God is greater than whatever it is I\u2019m doing right then, so  that I am moved to remember him in the way in which I was commanded.\u00a0 I  believe that the command to call people to pray in this manner has  spiritual power, and so I avail myself of the technology available to me  and I make it happen.<\/p>\n<p>There are all kinds of ways that I have allowed and conscientiously accepted the conditions of modernity or being modern.\u00a0 I know that my religion predates many of the daily situations I take for granted.\u00a0 Still, I don&#8217;t view trying to fit Islam and the modern world together as a struggle, but more of trying to make the pieces of an elaborate jigsaw puzzle fit together neatly.\u00a0 Some people enjoy putting puzzles together, others get frustrated with them.<\/p>\n<p>I obviously fit into the former category of individuals.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you&#8217;re curious as to what the Adhaan sounds like on my smartphone, here you go:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"390\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/EaCcbS2b4PI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>** Have you listened to Episode 3, yet?\u00a0 Download on iTunes or listen here ** In our last episode &#8220;Ignorant Americans, Blood Money and Grossed Out By Glee?&#8221;, we touched on the topic of negotiating our respective faiths in the context of modernity.\u00a0 When I was listening to the episode this morning, I realized that&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[17],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/122"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=122"}],"version-history":[{"count":14,"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/122\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":140,"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/122\/revisions\/140"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=122"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=122"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=122"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
