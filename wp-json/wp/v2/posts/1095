Mike (or Shiny) here.  It&#8217;s Monday evening, June 13 and I wanted to write a quick note.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday morning our nation endured yet another mass shooting tragedy &#8212; the worst of its kind in modern history. Over 100 patrons at a gay nightclub were shot by an individual, and 49 (at this writing) are dead. The shooter had a semiautomatic rifle and a handgun. During the assault he allegedly made a call to 911 and pledged his allegiance to ISIS. This has been on everyone&#8217;s mind over the past 48 hours.<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday evening, prior to this awful occurrence, Faiqa and I recorded a show where we paid tribute to the late and great Muhammad Ali. While he was provocative early on in his career, he was ultimately seen as a unifier. As someone who embraced people of all walks of life &#8211; not being afraid to stand up for what he believed in, and not afraid to seek justice for his community and that of others. At a time like this one when we&#8217;re seeing a massive amount of finger pointing, blame shifting and polarizing viewpoints, it&#8217;s important to think of Ali&#8217;s example.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday&#8217;s events hit many of us hard.  Faiqa has ties to Orlando and the Muslim community there, and is also a strong ally of the LGBT community (as we both are). It didn&#8217;t feel right to post an episode right away in the shadow of everything which has occurred.  I&#8217;ll be releasing the episode later this week for everyone to enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;d like to share something powerful which Faiqa shared on her Facebook page. (Many others have shared her words as well.)<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FNativeFaiqa%2Fposts%2F10157296804330227&#038;width=500&#038;show_text=true&#038;height=244&#038;appId\" width=\"500\" height=\"244\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Our thoughts are with all who are affected by this tragedy &#8211; especially the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives for celebrating being themselves. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to end with the words used by each of our communities when we comfort those grieving a loss:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Verily, unto God do we belong and, verily, unto Him we shall return&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 2:156)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;May the One whose Presence is felt here grant you consolation.&#8221;  (Midrash)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi.
