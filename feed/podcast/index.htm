	<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This isn’t a site or podcast about hummus.  It’s about respecting differences, finding points of intersection and asking difficult and awkward questions in the spirit of peaceful coexistence.  Mostly, what we’re trying to do here is answer that highly poignant question, “Can’t we all just get along?” The answer is, “Yes.  Yes we can… as long as you keep your hands of my hummus.”]]></itunes:summary>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve been gone for a few weeks: Faiqa has had a school year ramp up to success! And Mike was studying feverishly for the PMP exam &#8212; which he PASSED!</p>
<p>And with Faiqa taking a break for a few weeks, we have a pretty amazing guest host who took her place this week. Penina Beede is a rising stand-up comic who has performed in clubs in all three comedy hubs in the country: New York, Los Angeles, and the area in the middle of Connecticut that&#8217;s sort of Hartford but not really.  Mike and she knew each other from the Jewish youth group (USY) world, and Mike followed her on social media as she traveled halfway across the planet, joined the Israeli army, found love in Israel, realized it wasn&#8217;t quite for her, came back home, and realized her dream to perform comedy.  She talks about her experience as a female comic in an environment which has had its history of being hostile towards women, and her reflections on the growing number of men who have been called out for their acts of assault and harassment &#8212; and what the future holds for a profession which has had a need for change in power structure and balance for a long time.</p>
<p>We also talk about hummus a little bit. Because this is a show about, albeit in a roundabout way, hummus.</p>
<p>Penina joined us on this episode mere hours before getting on stage and performing a set at New York&#8217;s Dangerfield&#8217;s Comedy Club.  You can find more information about Penina and her upcoming appearances on her Facebook page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/realpeninabeede/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Penina Beede, Funny.</a>  She can also be followed on social media @realpeninabeede (on <a href="https://twitter.com/realpeninabeede" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/realpeninabeede/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>).</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This episode has practically everything. And it found its theme accidentally.</p>
<p>You see, our theme music is a song called <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYsE7_jOKrY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect One</a></em> by Man Bites Dog. Which I often mis-identify as <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoZxW8au0js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect World</a>,</em> a song by Huey Lewis and the News from their <a href="http://amzn.to/2iCRTww" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Small World</em></a> album.</p>
<p>So, naturally, we had to discuss one of the greatest bands to come out of the San Francisco Bay area, and then we waxed nostalgic about listening to the radio, joining the Columbia House Record and Tape Club, and so much more.</p>
<p>But our main topic is the latest revelations about (former) film industry mogul Harvey Weinstein &#8212; and how there has been such a culture of rampant sexual assault and harassment in Hollywood.  This led to women and men telling of their experiences in Hollywood. And it also helped to establish the #MeToo hashtag on social media where women and girls have been counting themselves as those who have been victims of sexual harassment and assault.  Actor Mayim Bialik discussed this in her New York Times Op-Ed titled <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/mayim-bialik-feminist-harvey-weinstein.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Being a Feminist in Harvey Weinstein’s World.</a> </em>She received some backlash for comments expressing that her modest dress and attitude has protected her from the risk of assault and harassment &#8212; and then she clarified in an apology for the &#8220;victim blaming&#8221; of her op-ed that the way one dresses does not guarantee protection where it comes to harassment and assault.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an important subject:  How many of you were aware of the #MeToo campaign on social media &#8212; and blown away by the number of women who declared that they have been put in that position?  Should there be a specific response from men who want to be allies and change the culture?  How will the culture of Hollywood change?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The country is reeling from the most devastating mass shooting in recent times which occurred in Las Vegas, NV last week. And, once again, the topic of gun control has come up in local media and government. What are we going to do about the access to firearms? What needs to change?</p>
<p>And the answer that often results? &#8220;It&#8217;s too soon to discuss this.&#8221; Right now it&#8217;s time to mourn for those whose lives were lost. To help the grieving families. Only after that healing has occurred should we talk about this.  Except then another shooting happens. And another one. And another one. And the conversation is not yet had.</p>
<p><em>Is it too soon to talk gun control now?  And if not now &#8212; when?</em></p>
<p>On this episode we (eventually) get around to talking about this issue &#8212; what hasn&#8217;t been working?  What happened this time that makes it any different from any of the other mass shootings? What can be done about it without infringing upon the rights of those who legally own firearms? The shooter used &#8220;bump stocks&#8221; to emulate the rapid fire of a fully-automatic rifle. Is that what killed people? Should devices like these be outlawed?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pretty serious topic, but we try our best to make it all entertaining and engaging in our own way.  What do you think? Are we on the right track?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have another special guest! Author <a href="http://www.rwspryszak.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RW (Bob) Spryszak</a> is the co-founder and fiction editor at <a href="http://www.thricefiction.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Thrice Fiction Magazine</a>. A native of Chicago, he started writing at an early age and fine-tuned it as member of a Marjorie Peters&#8217; Southside Creative Writers Workshop and then as a student at Columbia College of Chicago.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>We had a few technical difficulties with this episode, so if things towards the end sound a bit choppy and garbled &#8212; it&#8217;s not you; it&#8217;s us.</em></p>
<p>This episode talks about, among other things, certain tidbits from our respective religions which may surprise you a bit!  As members of the Jewish and Muslim communities, we think we know everything about our OWN groups, all of the stereotypes about us and more. But there are certainly deviations from what everyone thinks must be correct.</p>
<p>The show stems from an article from the Forward called <a href="http://forward.com/news/382144/by-the-numbers-10-surprising-demographic-facts-about-us-jews/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">By The Numbers: 10 Surprising Demographic Facts About U.S. Jews</a>. It takes a look at <a href="https://www.prri.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PRRI-Religion-Report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a recent study by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI)</a> which surveyed participants in the USA who identified either with a specific religious group or registered as unaffiliated.  The survey talks more about the trends of religious life and culture in the United States, but it has some interesting things to say about education levels, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation and more. Were you surprised by the results? Please let us know!</p>
<p>Of course feedback is always welcome: Please let us know: on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/heythatsmyhummus" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a> On Twitter: <a href="https://www.twitter.com/thatsmyhummus" target="_blank">@thatsmyhummus</a>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight it&#8217;s just Mike &#8212; Faiqa is taking the week off, but will return for our next episode!</p>
<p>This episode brings us a special interview with Holly Seibold, the founder and executive director of <a href="http://www.braws.org/" target="_blank">BRAWS</a> (Bringing Resources to Aid Women&#8217;s Shelters), a non-profit organization founded in 2015 which has been distributing women&#8217;s hygiene products and bras and underwear to women in shelters around the DC area. We talk about how she started the organization, the challenges of the ongoing stigma of menstruation, the battle against the &#8220;tampon tax&#8221; and more. </p>
<p>Holly is the winner of the 2016 Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce Emerging Influential Leader of the Year Award and Nominee for the Heroines of Washington 2017 award. Holly is a fierce advocate for women&#8217;s rights, testifying in Washington, DC and in Richmond, VA in favor of the repeal of the tampon tax and an increased access to menstrual supplies for all girls and women . Most recently, she participated in Congresswoman Grace Meng’s panel, <a href="https://meng.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/meng-introduces-legislation-to-require-ingredient-labeling-for-menstrual" target="_blank">“The Case for Menstrual Equity: How Policies Surrounding Menstruation Affect Outcomes for Women”</a> and was featured on the cover of the Washington Post in the article, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/the-once-whispered-topic-of-womens-menstruation-now-has-political-cachet/2017/08/07/cdeae46e-68a2-11e7-8eb5-cbccc2e7bfbf_story.html" target="_blank">&#8220;The Once-Whispered Topic of Women&#8217;s Menstruation Now Has Political Cachet.&#8221;</a> Holly has been featured on NBC4 Washington, ABC 7 News, Good Morning Washington, Northern Virginia Magazine, Fairfax Public Access, StreetSense.org, NPR, The GW Hatchet and the cover of the Connection Newspaper. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another recap of our zany lives! We delve into a random story about McDonalds character glasses that we all seemed to have in our kitchen cabinets in the late 70s / early 80s.   And we also discuss the observance of Eid al-Adha which was this past weekend, as well as what it symbolizes. There&#8217;s a bit in there about watching the solar eclipse a few weeks back as well!</p>
<p>And we discuss this article in the Forward: <a href="//forward.com/life/family/381528/when-my-daughters-teacher-erased-her-judaism-for-a-class-project/" target="_blank">&#8220;When My Daughter’s Teacher Erased Her Judaism For A Class Project.&#8221;</a>  What do we do when our own children&#8217;s heritage isn&#8217;t the origin story of pride that others might have? How do we remain sensitive to students who come to the table with different backgrounds and different ways of embracing their own history? </p>
<p>As always &#8212; looking for your input!  But also &#8212; looking for new guests to the show! Are you interested? Are you interesting? Do you know someone who is both?

<p>We talk about Faiqa&#8217;s trip around the world on four continents and over three of the five oceans of the world!  And we talk about some of the stuff Mike&#8217;s been doing as well &#8212; including his &#8220;Overnight&#8221; walk for Suicide Prevention Resources.</p>
<p>And we also have fun with Siri, asking it questions, demonstrating its shortcomings, and having it sing for us.</p>

Memphis was hit by a storm which knocked down power lines &#8212; leaving Faiqa with power for a week!  Fortunately all is right with the electrical lines now, and we bring you this episode today.</p>
<p>And today we wax organically.  Faiqa was a bit cut off from the world over the past week &#8212; an interesting experience in itself.  We recap how we manage when power is out.   We also talk about London, our president&#8217;s latest tweets and the two films which are currently taking America by storm &#8212; namely Wonder Woman and Boss Baby.  </p>

<p>We both have watched the new Netflix series &#8220;Dear White People,&#8221; a 10-part sorta-comedy about students at the fictional Westminster College where, in 2017, the student body realizes that, even on a progressive campus as theirs, racism still exists.  How do the characters interact?  Does this show get white people defensive? In fact &#8212; what have some of the reactions been to the show itself?</p>
<p>We also talk about the different sub-groups within our own cultures and how they compare and contrast.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re sort of all over the place during this one.</p>
<p>Aside from the friendly banter, we talk at first about the recent <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mikehayes/bomb-threats-jewish-centers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">epidemic of bomb threats called into Jewish institutions</a> &#8212; and the <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-03-24/unlikely-suspect-arrested-connection-over-100-bomb-threats-against-us-jewish" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprising suspect who was arrested</a>. Mike talks about his kid&#8217;s personal experiences with one of these incidents last month.</p>
<p>And then we talk about another issues that has started to gain attention: should marginalized groups have the responsibility to educate privileged groups? We came at this with different points of view, but it took an interesting turn.</p>
<p>(This video gives an interesting take on it. Have a look:)</p>
<p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGlg0nSSYNs</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another episode!  And it was recorded right as Faiqa and Mike were getting over nasty colds that make our voices sound all throaty and our throats sound all voicey. (No, I don&#8217;t know what that means either. But there&#8217;s a good deal of Sudafed in my system right now making me a bit loopy, so let&#8217;s just go with it.</p>
<p>Our condolences go to Faiqa&#8217;s father-in-law who passed away last week. Our thoughts are with her family. Faiqa opens up about the experience &#8212; explaining what happens when someone Muslim dies. And Mike recalls the passing of his mother years before, and how a Jewish family experiences the funeral and mourning periods. These are the types of things many people don&#8217;t learn about growing up in traditional households or educational institutions. So both of our discoveries and stories were quite powerful.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d love to hear about your experiences and traditions surrounding death and mourning.  Please let us know your thoughts on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/heythatsmyhummus" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a> or on Twitter: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/thatsmyhummus" target="_blank">@thatsmyhummus</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really should write a script which says &#8220;Sorry for the delay in posting; ________ got in the way.&#8221;  Because that&#8217;s what happened this time.  This podcast was recorded on February 15 &#8212; the day after Valentine&#8217;s Day!  The day after the day celebrating love (which technically is also a day to celebrate love. Like the other 363 days of the year. But anyway&#8230;)</p>
<p>So: We finally get around to talking about interfaith relationships and what our respective communities think about them. And why. Are attitudes changing? Are there certain challenges when a relationship or marriage crosses cultural or religious boundaries? We take a look at some of the relationships of those close to us and discuss.</p>
<p>We want you to support us in so many ways:  of course there&#8217;s the Amazon Banner at <a href="https://www.heythatsmyhummus.com/amazon">https://www.heythatsmyhummus.com/amazon</a>. Click on it and shop like you normally would on Amazon.com. We just get a little help. Also? Warby Parker&#8217;s great deal is still on! You can click here for further info: <a href="http://www.warbyparkertrial.com/hummus" target="_blank">http://www.warbyparkertrial.com/hummus</a> .</p>
<p>But enough about helping us: I mentioned a company which I decided to plug because they&#8217;re awesome and they&#8217;re going through a rough time: <a href="https://www.bluprintchocolatiers.com/" target="_blank">Blüprint Chocolatiers</a> is a local business in Alexandria, VA which has absolutely delicious treats. They happen to, by no fault of their own, be in the spotlight as they now share a building with professional hater Rich@rd Spencer. And some people have gathered that there is a connection between the chocolate shop and the racist tenant (which there is not). So &#8212; they deserve a lot of love. (And they&#8217;re working on an efficient means for delivery!) Check them out&#8230;</p>
<p>And, naturally, you can reach us at the usual places: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HeyThatsMyHummus/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/HeyThatsMyHummus/</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatsMyHummus" target="_blank">@ThatsMyHummus</a> on Twitter.  And our iTunes page is searchable. And begging for your five star reviews.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while! We recorded this one on February 3 &#8212; after both of us were incapacitated due to bad colds. These things happen&#8230;</p>
<p>But when we recorded, we had been doing quite a few things.  The &#8220;Muslim Ban&#8221; had been enacted by our President, and Mike went to Dulles Airport to protest and spread a message that immigrants and refugees are welcome here. Faiqa and her family marched in Memphis to the National Civil Rights Museum.  And so much other stuff happened in the aftermath &#8212; like the Bowling Green Massacre (not real) and the kinship between protesters of different faiths and cultures. Like, for instance, here:</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember how the <em>last</em> episode was all like &#8220;Wow! It&#8217;s been a long time?&#8221;</p>
<p>This break between shows was just a bit longer. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>You see &#8212; we recorded a show on the eve of the second presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.  Our show was our impressions of the <em>first</em> debate between the two. We were talking about all of the outrageous, unprecedented things that were happening during this presidential race. Things that we simply couldn&#8217;t fathom happening.</p>
<p>Until the next day when something even more outrageous happened. And then the next day. And then the next. Things got busy, things got intense, and we decided that we would resume our podcast right after the presidential election and the obvious victory of Hillary Clinton, the first female president elect of the United States.</p>
<p>Things turned out a bit differently.</p>
<p>The election results threw us for a loop. Both Faiqa and Mike had very strong concerns (we still do!) about the direction that our country was taking and has continued to take.  What does it mean when we saw that so many people voted for a candidate who has said disparaging things about women, Muslims, immigrants and many other people? How do we process a nation which is so utterly divided and needs something or someone to bring us together? What happens when there is a void in the position to do exactly that?</p>
<p>What do we do as we begin 2017 with a new administration? What are the next steps?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what we talk about in this episode &#8212; which we recorded on Sunday, January 8, 2017 &#8212; mere hours before Faiqa&#8217;s birthday. It&#8217;s longer than usual. And emotional. It took a long while for us to be back at a point where we felt we could do this. But we&#8217;re so grateful that we <I>are</I> back.  And that you&#8217;re back, too.  If you&#8217;re listening, that is&#8230;</p>
<p>What also makes us happy is when you get in touch with us via Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatsMyHummus" target="_blank">@ThatsMyHummus</a>.  Or via Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HeyThatsMyHummus/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/HeyThatsMyHummus/</a>.  And when you subscribe on iTunes. And rate us real good.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow! It&#8217;s been a long time&#8230;</p>
<p>The past two months have been a bit crazy in our lives.  In fact, while we were able to record this episode &#8212; which includes a great interview with a special guest &#8212; it took a good month to edit and do post-production on it. We didn&#8217;t think it would take quite this long, and we appreciate your patience throughout the past few weeks.  We hope it won&#8217;t be such a long wait for our next episode.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s not get ahead of ourselves!  This episode, recorded in the middle of August, has us joined by cultural curmudgeon and brash social flaneur<a href="http://momentitiousness.com/" target="_blank">Jason Leclerc</a>.  Jason is the author of <em>Momentitiousness</em> and its follow-up <em>Black Kettle.</em> We discuss his unique literary style, intertwining new characters and settings with current social commentary.</p>
<p>You can find Jason on Twitter here: <a href="https://twitter.com/JLeclercAuthor" target="_blank">@JLeclercAuthor</a>. Or on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MOMENTITIOUSNESS/" target="_blank">Facebook here</a>. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we recorded this episode, we were in a different world. Donald Trump had been nominated as the GOP presidential candidate, but he had not yet accepted the nomination nor spoke in front of the Convention.  This was this past Thursday evening, and if you&#8217;re listening to this now you know far more about what transpired than we did. We prognosticated as to what would happen during the speech, and you have the power to see if we were on track or completely off base.</p>
<p>We also spoke about the Republican National Convention in general &#8212; including some of the speakers, the scandal surrounding Melania Trump&#8217;s speech and its authorship, and the rocky start with delegates wanting to be &#8220;unbound&#8221; from their votes. This has been a fascinating election season so far, and it&#8217;s just the beginning!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have another &#8220;Best Of&#8221; episode!  And a special guest host filling in as we introduce old clips!  Janelle is a dear friend of both of ours and also lives in Tennessee (albeit the other side of the state).  She&#8217;s been a big HTMH fan for five years now, and it was an honor having her help out.  Janelle can also be heard on her podcast <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-160430134" target="_blank">Clarksville Conversations</a>.</p>
<p>The first segment comes from our Episode #1 (which is actually our second episode, since we started with episode 0.  We&#8217;re absolute ordinal that way!).  Recently we&#8217;ve heard statements from Newt Gingrich about &#8220;Sharia Law&#8221; and testing Muslim immigrants by asking if they believe in Sharia Law and using that answer to determine entry to the USA.  This episode has Faiqa explaining a little more about what Sharia <em>actually</em> is and how it&#8217;s being misrepresented as an overshadowing of civil law. <em>(From March 16, 2011)</em></p>
<p>Our next segment continues with a similar theme as Faiqa talks about the label of &#8220;Progressive Muslims&#8221; and what that stands for &#8212; especially in the United States. <em>(From June 15, 2012)</em></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we&#8217;re taking a look waaaay back into the depths of our collective HTMH refrigerator &#8212; to pull out some hummus that&#8217;s been sitting there for a <em>looong</em> time&#8230;</p>
<p>(Figuratively speaking, of course. Maybe.)</p>
<p>We took a pretty long hiatus after recording a good 74 episodes or so from 2011 through 2013.  And some of these older episodes discuss some fascinating subjects which relate to what&#8217;s going on nowadays.  For instance &#8212; we discussed the riots in Great Britain following the police shooting of a Black man which outraged a nation in our episode #22 recorded in August 2011.  This was before the world had heard of Michael Brown, Eric Gardner or Tamir Rice.  And with the latest episodes of African-American men being shot and killed by police officers as well as the tragic assassination of police officers in Dallas following a Black Lives Matter march, listening to what we discussed back then was rather interesting.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton&#8217;s email investigation remains a hot topic in 2016. It stemmed from emails subpoenaed regarding the Benghazi attacks on the American Embassy to Libya in September of 2012 in which four Americans were killed &#8212; and where there was some initial confusion as to the nature of the events leading up to the attack. A parallel protest was occurring at the American Embassy in Cairo and it was thought that something similar was happening in Benghazi when initial assessments were made.  In episode #58 we talk about &#8220;The Innocence of Muslims,&#8221; the inflammatory film which outraged Muslims in the Middle East and worldwide.  You can listen to our analysis before we knew that this would become a talking point against Secretary Clinton for the next several years.</p>

What&#8217;s coming up next?  Follow along with us as we talk TV, politics, sports, literature and astronomy.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a week of mourning and remembering the tragedy in Orlando last week &#8212; and as we continue to find new information about the shooter, people are continuing to try to wrap their heads around how and why this happened and if future similar tragedies can be prevented. We take a look at this from several angles:  from the prospect (and verbiage) of &#8220;Radical Islam&#8221; to the accessibility of firearms to the character and background of the shooter himself. Faiqa then talks about the issues within the American Muslim community in coming to terms with the homophobia which often goes unchallenged.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a heavy episode, we know.  But we do mention that this is Mike&#8217;s first on-location remote recording from his son&#8217;s school. And we talk about preferred snack foods of the new cast of <em>Ghostbusters.</em>  If you have anything to add, please tell us what you think on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/HeyThatsMyHummus" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ThatsMyHummus" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Hey! That&#8217;s My Hummus!</em> has a few new features you should be aware of:</p>
<li>We now have a direct gateway to our &#8220;Shop Amazon&#8221; page &#8212; which you can reach at the top navigation of our website or, alternatively, at <a href="https://www.heythatsmyhummus.com/amazon">https://www.heythatsmyhummus.com/amazon</a><br />
<BR /></p>
<li>We also began a new feature on today&#8217;s show where we went over the weather for listeners in certain areas.  But we&#8217;re not sure if this is going to become a regular occurrence or not&#8230;<br />
<BR /><BR /><br />
Our main story is one that has been in the news over the past several days:  <a href="http://time.com/4352233/cincinnati-zoo-gorilla-dragged-child/" target="_blank">A child fell into the Silverback gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo, prompting the zoo&#8217;s response team to shoot and kill the 17 year-old gorilla.</a> And the entire internet has gone wild with reactions and responses.</p>
<p>We talk a bit about these responses as well as about zoos in general:  are we at a point where they should finally be retired? We also discuss the strong reactions people are having towards the mother of the child who was in the enclosure. And we end up talking about our own parental mistakes which have cost us those coveted &#8220;parent of the year&#8221; awards.</p>
<p>How about you?  How have you demonstrated that you&#8217;re not the perfect parent?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s show was a mix of a few random stories that came up in the news. You might find it interesting to know that they all had a common thread even if unintended: sex and objectification.</p>
<p>But that wasn&#8217;t what we found interesting.</p>
<p>We found it fascinating, in fact, that this show was specifically <em>not</em> about music. Yet in the first segment we happen to mention the names of numerous bands in context &#8212; including Bon Jovi, the Cult, Another Bad Creation, Kriss Kross, Tone Lōc, Jewish Sensation the Miami Boys Choir, and Muslim superstars N2K.</p>
<p>We also talk a bit about dress codes, the evolution of sexual harassment awareness, and dumb things politicians say when they think they&#8217;re helping but they&#8217;re really not.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have a special guest in studio this week &#8212; a 13 year-old named Avi who also happens to be closely related to one of our hosts!</p>
<p>And since he just turned 13 a matter of months ago, as a Jewish kid coming of age he just became a <em>bar mitzvah</em> this past January.  Learn a bit about his journey, his preparation, the type of candy he prefers people pelt at him, and how his bar mitzvah party was truly on fire!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong></em>There is singing on this episode!<em></strong></p>
<p>Granted it&#8217;s not the most impressive singing, but it&#8217;s still singing. To children&#8217;s songs. On YouTube.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;re getting ahead of ourselves.  This episode is about two things specifically. The first of which is what happens when there are misunderstandings which occur in escalated situations due to someone using language which isn&#8217;t fully understood. We talk about the recent incident onboard a Southwest Airlines flight where <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/17/us/southwest-muslim-passenger-removed/" target="_blank">a passenger was removed</a> due to his overheard spoken Arabic phrase of &#8220;Inshallah.&#8221;  And we also discuss a bus trip in Texas where a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/29/sikh-man-arrested-bus-terrorist-bomb-islamophobia" target="_blank">Sikh man was removed</a> for speaking in Punjabi with a fellow passenger.  In both cases, other passengers felt that their safety was at risk.  Was this simply a language barrier? And what does </em>Inshallah<em> mean, anyway?</p>
<p>And then we talk about the Biblical (and Quranic) stories of Noah and the ark.  Are the narratives we learned rooted in truth? Does the Noah story contradict what we know in modern science?</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s some singing and rejoicing.</p>
<p>Do you want more singing? Should we not quit our day jobs?  Tell us what you think on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/HeyThatsMyHummus" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ThatsMyHummus" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a very special episode:  Faiqa&#8217;s on her own to host this one, but she welcomes a special guest to help talk about these two Jewish traditions.</p>
<p>First &#8212; Passover.  We&#8217;ve done Passover quite a bit on this show.  Check out <a href="https://www.heythatsmyhummus.com/2011/04/episode-6-passover-burqa-bans-and-birth-certificates/" target="_blank">Episode 6</a>, <a href="https://www.heythatsmyhummus.com/2012/04/hey-thats-mikes-matzah-listen/" target="_blank">Episode 46</a> and <a href="https://www.heythatsmyhummus.com/2013/03/this-years-passover-episode/" target="_blank">Episode 67</a> if you have some free time. </p>
<p>However, this year we talk about a new decision regarding Kosher for Passover food:  The Rabbinical Assembly&#8217;s Committee for Jewish Laws and Standards passed a resolution in November stating that it is permissible for Ashkenazic Jews (from Eastern-European descent) to <a href="https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/2011-2020/Levin-Reisner-Kitniyot.pdf" target="_blank">eat legumes (or <em>kitniyot</em>) on Passover</a>. This is a new development which reverses an 800 year old edict.  How is that going to change things?</p>
<p>And we also talk about the Jewish ritual bath, or <em>mikveh</em> &#8212; and how it&#8217;s being re-purposed for a new generation.  Traditionally used primarily by converts to Judaism to seal the deal and by married women ending their menstrual periods, communities (like ones in Boston and Washington, DC) are encouraging mikveh use for personal transitions and reflection.  Listen to find out more&#8230;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Ripped from the headlines!</em></p>
<p>We discuss two recent news stories that have had some traction lately&#8230;</p>
<p>First, a Muslim seventh grade student from Houston was singled out in his class and told that <a href="http://www.khou.com/news/family-upset-after-teacher-allegedly-calls-student-a-terrorist/114641445" target="_blank">&#8220;we all think you&#8217;re a terrorist&#8221;</a> when he laughed at a movie (Bend It Like Beckham) they had been watching. The teacher defended her actions saying that she was trying to teach the class about negative stereotypes. The student&#8217;s parents want the teacher removed. We discuss our experiences with being singled out due to stereotypes &#8212; and what we should be doing to ensure that this is not a common occurrence.</p>
<p>And then we talk about the recent passage of &#8220;bathroom bills&#8221; which have popped up in the south (including <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article68401147.html" target="_blank">North Carolina&#8217;s HB2</a>) which adversely affect the trans community and mandate that people (including students) use restrooms consistent with the sex on their birth certificate &#8212; even if that does not match their gender identity.  What&#8217;s behind the fear-mongering?  And how do our own religious and cultural traditions deal with transgender identity?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s talk about hair:  each strand of it contains your DNA &#8212; which are the building blocks of <I>you</I>. Every little individual trait is encoded on that one little piece of hair.</p>
<p>And that strand?  It&#8217;s strong. It can hold up to 100 grams.  Multiply that by the 100,000 strands on the average human head and that&#8217;s the weight of two elephants.  Really sturdy stuff.</p>
<p>But hair is also a marker for identity and individuality.  And hair has had cultural significance throughout world history. This past week this became an issue at San Francisco State University when <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-sf-state-dreadlocks-20160329-story.html" target="_blank">a video of an altercation between a student of color and a white student with dreadlocks</a> became public. Was this a case of cultural appropriation?  Was it inappropriate?</p>
<p>We also discuss what our own religions and cultures say about hair.  And our own experiences with the way we style, color or cover it.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230; doesn&#8217;t necessarily stay on campus.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s episode goes back to college &#8212; as we discuss some issues which have been newsworthy lately but have also been longstanding issues since we were both in school.</p>
<p>First: fraternities on campus. There have been episodes of dangerous behavior contributing to major injuries and death due to hazing as well as a culture which has promoted sexual assault. What are colleges (and fraternities) doing about this? Is it enough?</p>
<p>We then talk about a resolution recently passed at the University of California condemning antisemitism. There have been increasing numbers of incidents where protests against Israeli policy have crossed a line into tactics which target Jewish groups.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a valid question: Whatever <em>did</em> happen to predictability?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s our TV talk episode! We talk about our experiences watching two recent Netflix shows:  Fuller House and Master of None.  And how they both impacted us culturally and nostalgically.</p>
<p>We also delve into some of our other favorite shows.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8230; you make an overstated cliche that everyone already knows.</em></p>
<p>This week we take a break from the usual review of current events with our commentary sprinkled in &#8212; and we talk about ourselves.  There is far more to each of us than &#8220;Jewish, male podcast host&#8221; and &#8220;Muslim female podcast host.&#8221; Those around us have made assumptions about who we are, what we stand for, and how we think. But as multi-faceted individuals, sometimes they don&#8217;t get it right.  Each of us took five points which we feel people have assumed incorrectly about us.</p>
<p>So? Listen! And also &#8212; let us know what assumptions people have made about you&#8230;  Find us on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/HeyThatsMyHummus" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ThatsMyHummus" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.

<p><em>&#8220;Patronage denial, Crocodile!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This week&#8217;s show starts by talking about a specific boycott threat of Lands&#8217; End &#8212; the company that makes quality catalog-ordered clothing and accessories.  When they decided to place a featured interview with Ms. Magazine founder and feminist activist Gloria Steinem in their latest issue, they received backlash due to Steinem&#8217;s reproductive rights stance and activism, even though not one word was mentioned about this in the piece. Lands&#8217; End decided to retract the article and apologize to those who were offended.  Do boycotts (or threats of boycotts) end up with capitulation of the company? Or do they simply make a statement without enacting change?</p>
<p>We also talk about the discrimination lawsuit Israeli airline El Al faces due to a female passenger being asked to change her seat by a flight attendant because an Ultra-Orthodox passenger didn&#8217;t want to sit next to a woman.  Faiqa retells her similar experience when traveling to Pakistan as a teen.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your tray-tables are in their upright and locked position before listening to today&#8217;s episode.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re back after a short, 126-week break.  Hopefully this isn&#8217;t a pattern &#8212; but if it is, we&#8217;ll look forward to recording again in October 2018.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s episode has us talking current events: Presidential candidate Donald Trump told an apocryphal wild story at a campaign stop in South Carolina about a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/19/politics/donald-trump-south-carolina-john-pershing/" target="_blank">U.S. Army General who would combat Muslim insurgents by shooting them with bullets dipped in pigs&#8217; blood</a>. Trump is the front-runner in the race for the Republican nomination. We discuss the culture of xenophobia and how it&#8217;s pumped up by Trump&#8217;s campaign.</p>
<p>We also talk about the latest legal battle for pop singer Kesha (formerly Ke$ha) who has accused her producer, Dr. Luke, of sexual harassment and assault and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/24/kesha-dr-luke-contract-facebook-statement" target="_blank">has requested to extricate herself from her contract.</a> While many artists have come to her aid, Dr. Luke maintains his innocence. Will there be an equitable resolution?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got comments, questionable flattery and show ideas, or you just want to welcome us back, you can also let us know on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/HeyThatsMyHummus">Facebook</a> or tweet us <a href="https://twitter.com/thatsmyhummus">@thatsmyhummus.</a></p>

<p>Yes.  Christmas.  I&#8217;m Jewish, she&#8217;s Muslim. And this is a Christmas episode. Why? Just because. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>We do, however, talk about a couple of other things:  Faiqa (the one who isn&#8217;t Jewish) wrote <a title="Five Hanukkah Lessons" href="http://www.babble.com/babble-voices/native-born-and-raised-faiqa-khan/2012/12/04/5-hanukkah-lessons/" target="_blank">an article about the winter holiday of Hanukkah</a> (the one that is Jewish) &#8212; and got some flack about it.   And the recent shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, CT was on our minds as well.</p>
<p>But we end it by celebrating Christmas &#8212; yes, Christmas &#8212; through a way both of us could connect.  How? You&#8217;ll see&#8230;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey! It&#8217;s us.  We&#8217;ve missed you. Have you missed us? Yes? Good.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a bit of time since our last podcast as we&#8217;ve been busy during these final few weeks of summer (summer trips to California and NYC to be a panelist at BlogHer &#8217;12, *ahem*). But we&#8217;re still thinking about you (honest!), and we&#8217;ll be back soon enough to deliver you some of the best new content you can find on a Jewish/Muslim podcast.</p>
<p>But first &#8212; did you know that we&#8217;re heading towards the end of the Muslim month of <em>Ramadan</em>?  It&#8217;s one of the reasons Faiqa&#8217;s evenings have been busy &#8212; as she fasts all day and observes a feast after sundown.  And this weekend begins Eid al-Fitr!  Which, in English, means the &#8220;Holiday of Fitr!&#8221;  (As you can sense, Shiny wrote this paragraph.)</p>
<p>As we wish Faiqa an <em>Eid Mubarak,</em>  let&#8217;s go back into our archives and listen to an episode from last year where she and I discuss our two very different (yet simultaneous) fasts which we observed. Two religions, one joint craving for pizza.</p>
<p>Oh &#8212; and buy stuff! From our Amazon page!  Click on the banner.  It will help us out.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>This Week&#8217;s &#8220;Extra Credit&#8221;:<br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.<br />
&#8211;Viktor Frankl</p></blockquote>
<p>In this episode, we discuss human rights in the context of imprisonment. At 19, I read a book that changed my life irrevocably. It was by psychiatrist, existentialist and Holocaust survivor Dr. Viktor Frankl. The book, called <em>Man&#8217;s Search for Meaning</em>, documents Dr. Frankl&#8217;s time at the notorious Aushcwitz prison camp and describes the thought process he used to survive the most horrific of conditions. I&#8217;ve revisited this book several times since then and have drawn inspiration, strength and power from the words therein. Given the dreary circumstances we discuss in this week&#8217;s episode, I thought Dr. Frankl&#8217;s words might not only provide solace to individuals directly affected, but to all of us.</p>
<p><strong>If you decide to<strong> buy the book by clicking the graphic below</strong>, we may very well realize our dream of <del datetime="2012-06-30T05:15:16+00:00">hiring an intern</del> um&#8230; <em>world peace</em>.<br />

<p>&#8211; See if you can spot the politically incorrect joke less than sixty seconds into the show. It ends with, &#8220;Okay. maybe that was politically incorrect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; First, we discuss President Obama&#8217;s executive order regarding illegal immigration.</p>
<p>&#8211; There is mention of the little known historical footnote known as the &#8220;The Great Polyester Pardon&#8221; issued during the Scheinberg presidency of &#8217;75-&#8217;78</p>
<p>&#8211; Forget freedom of the press, we&#8217;re talking about REAL civil liberties here: 32 ounce soda.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; &#8220;Dear Santa, Even though we are Jewish and Muslim, we would very much like an east Asian intern named Harold. Thanks, HTMH&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8211; Apparently, Mike doesn&#8217;t &#8220;drink soda&#8221; anymore. Isn&#8217;t he SO.GREAT.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>We&#8217;ve hit the 50 show mark! Woo hoo!</strong></p>
<p>And since we&#8217;ve made it to that point, we&#8217;re taking a quick break this week &#8212; no new show. However, we&#8217;re re-packaging an <em>old</em> show. Well, two, actually.  We&#8217;ve taken segments from two of our earlier shows (from all the way back in 2011) and repackaged them. Why? Because it&#8217;s a great way to hear us talk about topics which fascinated us back then (and still do now.)</p>
<p>Our first segment is from April 2011 &#8212; we talked about &#8220;Whitewashing Hollywood,&#8221; which is what happens when a white actor plays the part of an ethnic character.  It&#8217;s one of the best kinds of segments &#8212; which are the ones where Faiqa and Shiny vehemently disagree.</p>
<p>And then we move to the end of last summer &#8212; when we had a story about a woman who was in the middle of a controversy when she was denied access to an amusement park ride because she was wearing a hijab.  We talked about our own outward religious/cultural identities &#8212; as well as our own theme park experiences.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;ve heard these before &#8212; listen again! Nostalgia is cool. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>And after you&#8217;ve finished with this episode? Listen to <a title="Hey! That's My Hummus! Rachel Reynolds" href="https://www.heythatsmyhummus.com/2012/06/listen-we-have-company-rachel-reynolds-four-seasons-for-charlotte/">our last episode featuring Rachel Reynolds</a> again. It&#8217;s one of the best we&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

<p>Then we go across the Atlantic to Toulouse, France.  It began on March 11 and ended there yesterday evening. A killing spree executed by a Frenchmen named Muhammed Merah that resulted in the death of 4 soldiers, 3 children and their father and teacher. In this episode of Hey Thats My Hummus, we’ll talk openly with one another about observations and feelings about this senseless act that affects each of us personally.</p>
<p>A special thanks to those of you who have been listening for the past year.  Your support, kind words and listenership is appreciated so very much. For real.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pinocchio’s conscience was a cricket.  Do you remember that part of the story? Apparently, the Virginia legislature doesn’t need crickets because it’s got it own little &#8220;conscience clause&#8221; chirping away on a piece of legislation concerning adoptions that would allow religious organizations to disqualify potential parents they find to be &#8220;morally objectionable.&#8221; Specifically, &#8220;same sex couples.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Abigail Fisher didn&#8217;t get into the University of Texas. And she feels that her race had something to do with it.  Since Fisher is a white woman and not African-American nor Latina, she feels that the University took a look at race as a factor alongside her academic merits. Her lawsuit will be heard at the Supreme Court &#8212; where the issue of Affirmative Action will come up yet again.  Are we finally at a time where we no longer need to look at race and ethnicity to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity?</p>
<p>***<br />
So, people, are you ready for Hey! That’s My Hummus! the week of February 20, 2012?  Here’s hoping your answer is in the affirmative&#8230;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re baaaaack.</p>
<p>Hope you had a great (insert appropriate holiday here), but time to get back to work!  Or not!</p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard, but the cool thing to do this year was watch a Big Bang Theory marathon on TBS.  The uncool thing to do was actually go out and party OR, according to many progressives and liberals, help amend existing literature that suspends an American&#8217;s rights to a speedy trial</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;On the last day of 2011, President Obama signed into law the <strong><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS.../pdf/BILLS-112hr1540rh.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2012</a></strong> (NDAA)&#8230;One of the provisions included in the 2012 NDAA is one that allows for American citizens suspected of terrorism to be indefinitely detained in military custody without charge or trial. As Pfc. Bradley Manning <strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/23/bradley-manning-pre-trial-hearing" target="_blank">begins</a></strong> the pre-trial hearing process after nearly 18 months of being held in military detention, the president has just signed into law a bill that will allow the military to treat American civilians in a similar fashion if they are suspected of conducting activities related to domestic terrorism.&#8221; &#8212; <a href="http://nextgenjournal.com/2012/01/the-ndaa-debate/">Amanda Fox-Roucher, &#8220;The NDAA Debate,&#8221; nexgenJOURNAL</a></p></blockquote>
<p>And then we travel over to the other world and discover that fundamentalism isn&#8217;t just the dominion of Muslims.  In fact, mounting tensions between secular and ultra Orthodox Jews are revealing that going too far isn&#8217;t just the domain of one faith.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Naama Margolis, an 8-year-old from Bet Shemesh, is the most famous girl in Israel today. In fact, nobody can stop talking about her.</div>
<p>And why is that? Well, on Friday evening, Naama told her story on the most watched news show in the country. Interviewed by Channel 2’s Shai Gal, Naama told how she was afraid to go to school, just a few hundred meters from her house in Bet Shemesh, because Haredim cursed and spit on her for being dressed “immodestly.” &#8212; <a href="http://972mag.com/watch-ultra-orthodox-spit-on-immodest-8-year-old-girl-in-bet-shemesh/31268/">Ami Kaufman, +972, 12/25/2011</a></p></blockquote>

Death Camp,</em> chronicling the happenings in the Berga concentration camp where 350 American P.O.W.&#8217;s were subjected to forced labor and inhumane conditions.  You can find out more about it and see a clip <a title="US Soldiers in Danger" href="http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/player/national-geographic-channel/shows/explorer-1/ngc-us-soldiers-in-danger.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  The program debuts on Sunday, December 18 at 9:00pm ET/PT.</p>
<p>We also switch gears and discuss Lowe&#8217;s home improvement&#8217;s decision to stop advertising on TLC&#8217;s series <em>All-American Muslim.</em>  Faiqa writes a powerful blog entry about it <a title="Native Born: And then there’s the Lowe’s “thing.”" href="http://native-born.com/2011/12/14/and-then-theres-the-lowes-thing/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we discuss gender in two very different contexts.</p>
<p>From the <em>New York World</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the morning of October 12, Melissa Franchy boarded the B110 bus in Brooklyn and sat down near the front. For a few minutes she was left in silence, although the other passengers gave her a noticeably wide berth. But as the bus began to fill up, the men told her that she had to get up. Move to the back, they insisted.</p></blockquote>
<p>We then switch gears and discuss transgendered children in the context of <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/girl-scouts-waffle-transgender-bobby-montaya-join/story?id=14825506">a little boy who was recently admitted to the Girl Scouts of America.</a><br />

<p>SOS Racisme said the application, sold for 0.79 euro cents ($1.07) on the Apple Store France, violates France&#8217;s strict laws banning the compiling of people&#8217;s personal details without their consent.</p>

<em>Eid Mubarak!  </em>Muslims have been marking the end of Ramadan over the past few days worldwide with <em>Eid-al-Fitr,</em> perhaps the biggest holiday within the calendar. It also is the beginning of the month of <em>Shawwal.</em>  Because the Islamic calendar is based on the lunar cycles, it&#8217;s an observance which actually begins at sundown. Similar to Jewish holidays &#8212; which also follow a lunar calendar.</p>
<p>Faiqa has a <a title="Native Born" href="http://native-born.com/2011/08/31/eid-ul-fitr-2011-or-is-it-yes-it-is-or-it-was/#comments" target="_blank">wonderful post about Eid-al-Fitr</a> at her blog. She also discusses the ongoing issues with determining exactly when the calendar date should fall in different parts of the world.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_439" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-439" style="width: 193px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ethansphotosarecool/4194513323/"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-439" style="margin: 4px;" title="4194513323_3bfd5c10c3[1]" src="http://www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/4194513323_3bfd5c10c31-275x300.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="210" srcset="https://www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/4194513323_3bfd5c10c31-275x300.jpg 275w, https://www.HeyThatsMyHummus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/4194513323_3bfd5c10c31.jpg 459w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-439" class="wp-caption-text">(cc) Ethan Ableman via Flickr</figcaption></figure>But as we&#8217;ve discussed on the show, it&#8217;s quite interesting to see what Judaism and Islam have in common where it comes to our way of keeping time. Although we both have calendars based on the moon with twelve months apiece, the Jewish calendar throws in leap years to keep the lunar years consistent with the solar calendar. That&#8217;s why Passover and Hannukah fall around the same times every year, while Ramadan and Eid-al-Fitr are several weeks earlier year after year. (The Jewish calendar has a 19 year cycle in which seven of those years include a whole extra month&#8230; but your head will likely explode if I explain all of this right now.)</p>
<p>The point of this is that Judaism is beginning a new month as well &#8212; the month of <em>Elul.</em>  It&#8217;s the last month of the Jewish calendar, and it has a bit of significance. First of all, the name is an acronym for the Hebrew <em>Ani l&#8217;dodi v&#8217;dodi li </em>&#8212; which means &#8220;I am for my beloved, and my beloved is for me.&#8221;  Sweet, no?  Also, it that it is the last month of the Jewish year, it&#8217;s a preparation month for the more solemn New Year <em>(Rosh Hashanah)</em> which comes in one month. And to get people into that state of mind, the <em>shofar</em> is sounded every day (aside from the Sabbath).</p>
<p>Okay. The <em>real</em> point of this is that Faiqa and Shiny are very busy right now. Celebrating. Observing. So we don&#8217;t have a new podcast for you this week. However, we <em>do</em> have some gifts &#8212; as per the tradition of <em>Eid.</em></p>
<p>First: a girl with some amazing lungs blowing the shofar:</p>
<p>httpv://youtu.be/DS8NoPRVjm0</p>
<p>Second: An awesome Eid celebration / dance number coming from&#8230; Canada?</p>
<p>httpv://youtu.be/le18hZJ780U</p>
<p>And third:  Faiqa and Shiny have put together a reel of <em>previously unreleased bonus footage</em> from <em>Hey! That&#8217;s My Hummus!  </em>Some are extended topics we discussed off-air; some are snippets of us from behind the scenes, and some are just&#8230; well, embarrassing outtakes which ended up getting cut. Enjoy! <em> (Note: These twelve minutes are available on the website only and are not on iTunes.)</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be back after Labor Day.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy <em>Tu B&#8217;Av</em>.</p>
<p>You have no idea what that means, do you?  So you should listen.</p>
<p>In light of the recent conviction of Warren Jeffs, Mike and I talked about polygamy and its place in modernity.  And completely forgot to talk about how gross Warren Jeffs really is.</p>
<p>I also read an op-ed piece entitled <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2025393/UK-riots-Haroon-Jahan-death-Legacy-society-believes-nothing.html">&#8220;Legacy of a Society That Believes in Nothing&#8221; from the U.K. Daily Mail</a> that was posted on a friend&#8217;s Facebook wall.  The author argue that the core issue of the U.K. riots lies in an overly secular society and further postulates, &#8220;without religion, we are all a little less human.&#8221;</p>
<p>Want to know what we think about that?</p>
<p>Of course you do.</p>

<p>Which is why, in episode 22 of <em>Hey! That&#8217;s My Hummus! </em>We discuss the recent violence and chaos which has troubled Great Britain over the past week. The riots sparked by the shooting death of a citizen by law enforcement has spiraled into something much more catastrophic, and we try to determine why and how something like this could happen. Our thoughts are with those affected on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>We also delve into a recent report by the Pew Research Center&#8217;s Forum on Religion in Public Life titled <em><a title="Rising Restrictions on Religion" href="http://pewforum.org/Government/Rising-Restrictions-on-Religion.aspx" target="_blank">Rising Restrictions on Religion</a>, </em>which talks about religious tolerance (and intolerance) in the countries around the world. Are nations becoming more restrictive about religion? Are they becoming more accepting?</p>
<p>But perhaps the toughest controversy of all is addressed: was KITT from <em>Knight Rider </em>voiced by the guy who played Mr. Belvedere?</p>
<p>Join us for this special episode &#8212; and share your thoughts with us! Do so here, on <a title="Facebook: Hey!

Twenty episodes! Where has the time gone?!?</p>
<p>It was just about one year ago that Faiqa and Shiny first discussed the idea of collaborating on a project that would ultimately become <em>Hey! That&#8217;s My Hummus!</em>  First we were thinking about co-authoring a blog. Then it was a book. Then a news-based television show. Then it was a wacky sitcom about two families, one Muslim and one Jewish, who share a backyard and a miniature talking horse named Vinny. And ultimately? We decided to set our aspirations higher and work together on a podcast.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a wonderful twenty podcasts. We&#8217;ve talked about a multitude of different subjects. We&#8217;ve laughed, yelled, agreed, disagreed, disagreed even more, and vehemently disagreed. And we love it. And we look forward to bringing you many more in the future.</p>
<p>Since Faiqa is at <em>BlogHer &#8217;11</em> this week, we&#8217;ve decided to put together a compilation of two segments from past shows: the first is the reason for the namesake of the podcast &#8212; the great hummus debate.  Our pilot episode had this topic span over two, fifteen-minute segments, but we&#8217;ve cut it down to just one.  And then we look back at our discussion about the advent of a Muslim superhero in the Batman comic book series &#8212; and the prevalence of religious diversity within the superhero world.</p>
<p>And if you thought it didn&#8217;t get any better than that &#8212; <em>we have a special, surprise guest host this week!   </em>Many thanks to this awesome person for helping us out.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t listened to our podcast before, this is a great one to listen to for a taste of what we&#8217;re all about.  If you have listened, please share this one amongst your friends if you think they might like it.  But listen anyway because &#8212; hey! Special Guest host!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be back next week for episode #21. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>That is <em>not</em> the real Dolly Parton in the picture above. Nor is it the real Amy Winehouse. If it were &#8212; it would be an even more amazing picture to go along with Episode 19!</p>
<p>(As far as I can tell, that&#8217;s also not the real Janis Joplin. The jury is out as to whether Debbie Gibson is genuine or not.)</p>
<p>Earlier this month at one of the <em>Dollywood</em> theme parks in Knoxville, TN a park patron was asked by the gate staff to turn her shirt inside-out. The reason? The slogan printed on her shirt, &#8220;Marriage is So Gay,&#8221; could be deemed offensive by other visitors in the park in this &#8220;family-friendly&#8221; environment. Did the park staff overreact? Was the t-shirt potentially incendiary? Join us as we discuss this.</p>
<p>And we also talk about the recent death of musician Amy Winehouse &#8212; and the reactions we&#8217;ve seen about the way she lived her life.</p>
<p>And Faiqa graces us with a special announcement!</p>
<p>Speaking of special announcements &#8212; <em>it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mere days until we record our &#8220;Ask a Jew&#8221; show!</span></em> We want <em>your</em> questions about Judaism &#8212; anything you&#8217;ve always wanted to know!  You can reply to this blog entry.

<p>But, WAIT!  There&#8217;s MORE!</p>
<p>From now on, HTMH episodes will be around 30 minutes.  Just enough time for you to listen while you, say, go to the store and <em>buy</em> hummus.  Think about it, you can <em>listen</em> to hummus, while <em>buying</em> hummus.  Surreal.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also be releasing twice a week, in case you can&#8217;t stand the idea of not listening to us an hour a week.</p>
<p>Finally, remember in HTMH#20, Mike will graciously answer all questions Jew-related in a very special &#8220;Ask A Jew.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>If you have any questions about Judaism (or, hey, questions just for Shiny &#8212; like, &#8220;Gee, Shiny, Pepsi or Coke?&#8221;), ask them NOW!  </strong></p>

<p>OmyGAWD, Mom, I wanted a <em>blue</em> BMW not a black one&#8230; you never get me <em>anything</em> I want. MTV shout out.  Does anyone even watch MTV, any more?</p>
<p>Anyway, in this episode of Hey! That&#8217;s My Hummus, we discuss the dark side of laws like the one currently being proposed in response to the Casey Anthony Trial.</p>
<p>We also discuss how and what we tell our kid&#8217;s about unpleasant current events.  Also, we reveal that Rupert Murdoch is actually from New Zealand and not Australia. No, not really. We actually discuss the impact of profit on journalistic ethics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Challenging the <em>Hey! That&#8217;s My Hummus </em>mantra of &#8220;Fair and Balanced,&#8221; episode #15 brings in a special guest host filling in for Faiqa &#8212; and she&#8217;s neither Muslim nor Floridian! It&#8217;s Kyra, who happens to be (a) Jewish and (b) married to Shiny.  This certainly throws the balance of the show off-kilter, and hilarity inevitably ensues.</p>
<p>We take a look at the phenomenon of &#8220;Jew collecting&#8221; &#8212; where Jews, as a novelty, will identify celebrities &#8212; especially professional sports players &#8212; who happen to also be Jewish.  (We&#8217;re guessing that this is done across many different religions, nationalities and cultures.) We also discuss effective parenting and discipline (being that both hosts are parents of the same kid), and we conclude with a frank discussion about social media connections and what makes those &#8220;friendships&#8221; different from other interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>Just a friendly reminder to <em>submit your questions for Shiny for Episode #20 &#8212; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ask The Jew!</span></em>  Shiny will be entertaining questions submitted on this blog, on Facebook, on Twitter (@ThatsMyHummus) and email at <a title="hey@HeyThatsMyHummus.com" href="mailto:hey@HeyThatsMyHummus.com">hey@heythatsmyhummus.com</a>.  We&#8217;ll be recording in only five weeks.</p>

And, then, we wrap it up with talking about how we wish our children would just go the F*%$! to sleep.]]></itunes:summary>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week Mike and I discussed the concept of customized search engine and social media filtering in the context that it&#8217;s being discussed in<a href="http://www.thefilterbubble.com/"> Eli Pariser&#8217;s book <em>The Filter Bubble: What The Internet is Hiding From You</em></a>.  In a grand experiment we searched three terms suggested by our Twitter followers:  muskrat, umbrella and occidental.   The results were&#8230; interesting.</p>
<p>We also discussed the impact of one day boycotts in light of WalMart&#8217;s recent victory in a gender discrimination case that was presided over in the Supreme Court and the total and complete immorality of remaking<em> Footloose.</em></p>
<p>That last part might just be <em>my</em> opinion.</p>

<p>I’m going to let you get on with the listening here in a second, but before I do that&#8230; did you know that next week is an “Ask the Muslim” episode?</p>
<p>You can ask me all sorts of questions.</p>
<p>Here’s some inspiration:</p>
<p><em>Do Muslims eat peanut butter?  If so, Jif or Peter Pan?</em></p>
<p><em>Come on, you really don’t eat bacon? </em></p>
<p><em>If a little girl takes a Barbie to Saudi Arabia, does the Barbie have to wear an abaya?</em></p>
<p><em>How many Muslims does it REALLY take to change a light bulb?</em></p>
<p>Seriously, ask me anything.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about treating me like a token because you can be assured I won’t act like one.  Much.</p>
<p>If you prefer to pose your questions privately, you can e-mail us at hey [at] heythatsmyhummus [dot] com</p>
<p>For those of you who are attention seekers, use the comments, our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/HeyThatsMyHummus">Facebook page</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/thatsmyhummus">Twitter.</a></p>

<p>As you probably know, the numbers 9 and 10 come after 8.</p>
<p>To celebrate the number 10, we&#8217;ve decided to make our tenth episode a little different and call it &#8220;Ask the Muslim.&#8221;  If <del>you need me to be your token ,</del> er, you&#8217;ve got <em>questions</em> for me, ask them here in the comments, on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/thatsmyhummus">twitter</a> or our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/HeyThatsMyHummus">Facebook</a> page.  Or, if you want to ask privately, just e-mail me at hey [at] heythatsmyhummus [com].</p>
<p>The whole tenth episode will be devoted to these questions, so make them good!  Or not.  Just ask me something so we don&#8217;t have to talk about vampires again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not totally clear on what happened on Good Friday, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that it&#8217;s not &#8216;happy&#8217;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, no Speedos?  I <em>LIKE</em> this religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should totally run for president, but I only have a short term birth certificate, so I guess that&#8217;s not gonna work&#8230; and a funny sounding name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8230; we had a president named Grover&#8230; <em>twice</em>.&#8221;</p>
